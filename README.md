# Gesture-Detection-Project-Self-Made-Image-Dataset

This project is aimed at building a gesture detection system using Python and a self-made dataset.

## Introduction
Gesture detection is an important area of computer vision that enables machines to recognize and interpret human gestures. In this project, we will build a gesture detection system using Python and a self-made dataset. We will use machine learning techniques to train a model on the dataset and use it to detect gestures in real-time.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a self-made dataset consisting of images of various hand gestures. The dataset contains 500 images, with each image having a resolution of 128x128 pixels. The dataset is divided into 5 categories, with each category representing a specific hand gesture.

## Requirements
To run the code in this project, you will need the following libraries and tools installed:

Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-Learn
OpenCV
Tensorflow

You can install these libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn opencv-python
Running the Code
To run the code, clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python model.py
This will launch the gesture detection system, and you can use your webcam to test the system by performing various hand gestures.

## Results
The result of this project is a gesture detection system that can recognize and interpret various hand gestures in real-time using a self-made dataset. The system can be used for various applications, such as sign language interpretation or human-computer interaction.

## Conclusion
In conclusion, this project demonstrates how to build a gesture detection system using Python and a self-made dataset. This project can be a good starting point for anyone interested in building a gesture detection system or exploring machine learning techniques in computer vision.
